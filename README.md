A4 - Class 04 Assignment

	We are going to build a Movie library application

	Download initial movie data file - you will only need to use the movies.csv

	Create Movie Console Application

	1. List all movies in the file
		Note: Do not just scroll all movies - be smart about how to display (is there a NuGet package that could help?)

	2. Allow adding movies to the file
		Do not enter duplicate IDs.  Determine how to best figure out the next/appropriate movieId ("identity") value to use
		Do not allow duplicate movie titles to be entered (exact string match is ok)

	Implement with the following features in mind
		Exception Handling
		NLog framework
		Consider creation of additional classes/methods
		Unit test (at least one test)
